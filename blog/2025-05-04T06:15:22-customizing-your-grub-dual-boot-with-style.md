Hey there! 👋  
Today I’m going to teach you (or at least try) how to add a theme to **GRUB**, so every time you boot your PC or switch operating systems, you don’t have to stare at that ugly default screen anymore.  
Let’s turn this:

## What Is GRUB?

For those unfamiliar, **GRUB** is a boot manager that comes by default with most Linux distributions.  
It’s essential if you use **dual boot** — that’s when you run more than one operating system (like Linux and Windows) on the same computer.

If you’re dual-booting without a boot manager, switching systems can be a nightmare — you’d have to open your BIOS every time and manually change the boot order.  
With GRUB (or any boot manager), you can visually select which OS to start, no BIOS trips required.

## Why Customize GRUB?

- 🎨 **Pure aesthetics** – Who said dual boot has to be ugly?
- 🔍 **Visual clarity** – Easily identify each OS at a glance [^1]
- 🚀 **Style points** – Because a slick boot screen says _“this machine belongs to someone serious”_

## Downloading a Theme

Enough theory — let’s jump to the fun part: finding a theme you like.  
Head to the **GNOME-Look GRUB Themes section**:

👉 [GNOME-Look — GRUB Themes](https://www.gnome-look.org/browse?cat=109&ord=rating)

That site has tons of GRUB themes.  
My personal favorite is this one: [Star Rail Theme](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/2076542), which includes multiple sub-themes — I’m currently using the **Anaxa** version.

## Installing the Theme

Before you mention it — yes, I know about **GRUB Customizer**,  
but we’re doing it the _proper way_ via terminal because it’s simpler and cleaner.

Using the [Star Rail Theme](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/2076542) as an example:  
Click **Download**, choose the version you like (`Anaxa.tar.gz` in my case), and extract it — it’s a GZIP file that contains all theme assets.

Once extracted, you’ll get a folder like this:

```shell
Anaxa
├── background.png
├── icons
│   ├── ......
│   ├── windows11.png
│   ├── windows.png
│   └── zorin.png
├── select_c.png
├── select_e.png
├── select_w.png
└── theme.txt
```

Basically, a theme is a folder with images and one main file — `theme.txt` — that defines layout and asset positioning.

### Step 1 — Create the GRUB Theme Folder

If it doesn’t already exist:

```shell
sudo mkdir -p /boot/grub/themes/
```

### Step 2 — Copy the Theme

```shell
sudo cp -r Downloads/Anaxa /boot/grub/themes/
```

### Step 3 — Check Your Screen Resolution

Run this command to get your monitor’s resolution:

```shell
xdpyinfo | awk '/dimensions/ {print $2}'
```

It should return something like `1920x1080`.

### Step 4 — Configure GRUB

Open the GRUB configuration file:

```shell
sudo nano /etc/default/grub
```

Find or add this line (replace **Anaxa** with your theme name):

```shell
GRUB_THEME="/boot/grub/themes/Anaxa/theme.txt"
```

Then scroll down and find this block:

```shell
# The resolution used on graphical terminal
# note that you can use only modes which your graphic card supports via VBE
# you can see them in real GRUB with the command `vbeinfo'
# GRUB_GFXMODE=auto
```

Uncomment and set the correct resolution you got earlier:

```shell
GRUB_GFXMODE=1920x1080
```

Save and exit (`CTRL+X`, then `Y`, then **Enter**).

Finally, update GRUB so it applies the new settings:

```shell
sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

Restart your computer, and voilà — your new stylish GRUB should appear:

> Ignore the small “Anaxa” label in the bottom-right corner — that’s just part of the theme preview.

### Edit Note

I forgot to mention — **Ventoy** also uses GRUB under the hood,
so it’s totally possible to theme it too.
Maybe I’ll cover that in a future post.
Oh, and I’ll probably update the Star Rail theme link to the GitHub version later.

[^1]: GRUB supports icons for easier visual identification, and most themes already include full icon sets for operating systems and Linux distros (like the ones in the example images).
