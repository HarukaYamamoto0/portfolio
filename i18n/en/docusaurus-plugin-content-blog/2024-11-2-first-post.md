It looks like this is my first post; I don’t really know what to say. I’m still developing the site, and I had let this project sit for almost a year. But recently, I bought the domain harukadev.com and thought, why not take advantage of this and get my act together to finish this project? Actually, I think I'm wrapping it up just so I don’t have to program.

It's just that in the past few days, I started working at a call center, and my life is pretty chaotic right now. The little time I have to code always ends up going to either watching anime or going to sleep since I get home quite late from work. Not to mention the imposter syndrome I've always had, so instead of working with Android and finishing the features for the Tabnews client, I’m here "procrastinating," doing something "easier."

Honestly, I’m enjoying creating this site. Docusaurus is quite handy; it was just a bit annoying to customize the colors and the footer. But aside from that, it's pretty nice to use. I’ll definitely look into integrating Obsidian or Notion so I can use it alongside the blog. It’s pretty tedious writing in a code editor like VS Code. I still need to figure out the spelling correction and translation into other languages.

I've done quite a bit for today; I think I deserve to watch an episode of Monster. See you!
